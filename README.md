StudentsYard
This app was built using eclipse way back before Android studiod was popular. The purpose of this app is works kind of like an advertisement app. You are able to post you old text books and other users will view it and buy it. You can also post any rooms that are for rent.
This is my first app i built.

I just recived an email from Parse and they are removing their database service, so the app will not work anymore until i get the atabase back up with another service.
